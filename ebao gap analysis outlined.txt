Gap Analysis Deliverables:
-----------------------

Scenario 1: New Products - product spec/spreadsheet to be provided by FTLife

Objective:
- Validate if InsureMO Product Factory can faciltate the setup of new products:
	- [Fully enabled] New Business Processes - Quotation/Proposal APIs for target Frontend POS Flow
	- [Gap Analysis required] Policy Administration - Servicing, Claim incl. inforce illustration

Measurement:
	- Time to Market for New Business : from XX days to YY days, where XX > YY, YY to be provided by eBAO, XX to be provided by FTLife
		- Setup once for all sales channel 
		- Shorter time to create similar product by cloning from existing one
	- Operation Efficiency : ease of maintenance and shorten issue resolution time related to product configuration
		- Single source of product definition and re-usable components like formulas

Approach:
- Evaluate the effort to completely setup the new products in InsureMO Product Factory, analysis the following gaps (if any)
	- [New Business] Check if New Business's proposal/quotation APIs functionable once the products setup completely, figure out gaps if any
	- [Policy Administration] Outline the methodology to incorporate the product setup data from InsureMO Product Factory to Core System incl. but not limited to following:
		1. For Product Factory, check the Gaps if any to incorporate "new" features from FTLife evolved these years - e.g. premium holidays, premium discount for New Products 
		2. The integration approach from Product Factory to Core System's tables (e.g. via CSV file + Manual Import  ...etc.)
		3. Analysis the list of tables in Core Systems involved for new products setup
		4. Analysis the additional items involved to complete the product setup for PA in Core System after above steps done (e.g. build formulas with PLSQL coding for inforce illustration)


Scenario 2: Existing on-shelf products in eBAO

Objective:
- Quickly enable Existing Products' Proposal/Illustration functionality for New Business
- Provides baseline view to FTLife to understand the overall migration efforts from Existing Platform to Product Factory (NB portion)


Approach:
- Evaluate the effort to migrate existing products to InsureMO Product Factory 



Outcome:
